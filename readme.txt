Codes for the papers "Zhang Z Y. Community structure detection in complex
 networks with partial background information", and "Enhanced Community
 Structure Detection in Complex Networks with Partial Background
 Information" by Zhong-Yuan Zhang, et al.
 

To run the tests, just load the files and run demo1.m in Matlab.

All codes are tested under Matlab Version 7.10.0.499 (R2010a), 64bit.

Feedback is very welcome. If you have found a bug, or have any problems or
commnets, please write to:
